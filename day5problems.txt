1. the list which contains the 10 recent transactions amount
a. insert 10 amount like we did warehouse program
b. put charges of 20rs if taken is happened more than 5 and subtract it at end of amount if its not sufficient to pay charges add as lien charges
Note: use recursion for all

2. Consider In array there are 20 integers, among try to find the one pair of duplicate and replace it by the nearest element + 10
eg:
[12,90,34,78,11,90]
output: [12,22,34,78,11,21]
Note: Use recursive function

3. print binary representaion of given int using recursion

4. Consider array of int , find the duplicates and check whether its divisable by NUM that user gonna give
Sample Input:
Array elements:
20 45 60 45 90 100
Enter the NUM:
5
Sample Output:
45

5. Find duplicates in array and if there is more than one form of duplicates perform ^ between two different duplicate and store it as end value in array before delete all those duplicates from an array
Sample input:
Enter the value of array:
[3,2,2,5,6,6,7]
Sample output:
[3,5,7,4]
Note: here result of ^ between 2 and 6 is 4 which stored @ end of an array
